# Welcome to my GitHub Repo For 'Improving Batter-Pitcher At-Bat Modeling Using K-Means Clustering and Mixture Models' 

Below you will find three versions of my paper:

** Report Full: ** This is the full version of my paper and what I would recommend. This version is about 30 pages and ~8000 words. 

** SABR Report: ** SABR asks papers to be limited to 5000 words, so this version is a bit briefer with more baseball emphasis. 

** Stats Background: ** This version is intended for a reader with a minimal baseball background, but a higher level statistics background.
